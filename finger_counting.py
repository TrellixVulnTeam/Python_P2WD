"""[MðŸ’™ Challenge] Finger Counting

Monday Blue ðŸ’™ Challenge Series #13

Let's do some counting this week! This time we will need to determine which finger was last counted using Sololand's arithmetic. Assume that we will use both our hands with 5 fingers, here's how we do the counting start with the left-hand:-

Left Hand       Right Hand
Thumb: 1        Thumb: 6
Index: 2        Index: 7
Middle: 3       Middle: 8
Ring: 4         Ring: 9
Baby: 5         Baby: 10

Once we reached to the end, we will continue the count backwards and here's the label for each of the fingers count up to 31:-

Left Hand
Thumb: 1, 19
Index: 2, 18, 20
Middle: 3, 17, 21
Ring: 4, 16, 22
Baby: 5, 15, 23

Right Hand
Thumb: 6, 14, 24
Index: 7, 13, 25, 31
Middle: 8, 12, 26, 30
Ring: 9, 11, 27, 29
Baby: 10, 28

TASK
Write a program to accept an integer and determine which finger was last counted with the given number.

TEST CASE
10 âž¡ "Baby Finger (Right)"
22 âž¡ "Ring Finger (Left)"
25 âž¡ "Index Finger (Right)"
42 âž¡ "Thumb (Right)"
101 âž¡ "Ring Finger (Right)"
1001  âž¡ "Ring Finger (Right)"
25122017  âž¡ "Ring Finger (Right)"
31122017  âž¡ "Middle Finger (Left)"

BONUS
Clear-cut and optimized approach is encouraged.

Happy Coding!!!
