"""Guitar Subset

For a list of integers S and a target number G, a subset of S that adds up to G is called a guitar subset.

For example:
Input:
24
[12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2]
Output:
[12, 9, 2, 1]
(G=24, S=[12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2], there is a guitar subset [12, 9, 2, 1] that adds up to 24).

Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.

Write a program to check if the user input has a guitar subset for the specified number G
or not (both the list of integers and the number G are input parameters).
